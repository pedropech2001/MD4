**Arrays data structure**

In a nutshell an array can be defined as an ordered collection of elements indexed by contiguous integers.
Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings. Array types are often implemented by array data structures, but sometimes by other means, such as hash tables, linked lists, or search trees.In Python, the built-in array data structure is a list.

*-Example of Array In C programming-*

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int avg = 0;
    int sum =0;
    int x=0;

    /* Array- declaration â€“ length 4*/
    int num[4];

    /* We are using a for loop to traverse through the array
     * while storing the entered values in the array
     */
    for (x=0; x<4;x++)
    {
        printf("Enter number %d \n", (x+1));
        scanf("%d", &num[x]);
    }
    for (x=0; x<4;x++)
    {
        sum = sum+num[x];
    }

    avg = sum/4;
    printf("Average of entered number is: %d", avg);
    return 0;
    
    
   **Two dimensional arrays**
   
   
An array of arrays is known as 2D array. The two dimensional array, is also known as matrix. A matrix can be represented as a table of rows and columns. Before we discuss more about two Dimensional array lets have a look at the following C program.

*-Two-dimensional array example in C-*

'''
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
   /* 2D array declaration*/
   int disp[2][3];
   /*Counter variables for the loop*/
   int i, j;
   for(i=0; i<2; i++) {
      for(j=0;j<3;j++) {
         printf("Enter value for disp[%d][%d]:", i, j);
         scanf("%d", &disp[i][j]);
      }
   }
   //Displaying array elements
   printf("Two Dimensional array elements:\n");
   for(i=0; i<2; i++) {
      for(j=0;j<3;j++) {
         printf("%d ", disp[i][j]);
         if(j==2){
            printf("\n");
         }
      }
   }
   return 0;
   '''
